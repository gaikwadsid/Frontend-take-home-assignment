Take-Home Frontend assignment Setup Instructions:

My app uses react native and was developed on iOS so you will need Expo to run the project.

Install expo here: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/

Install a phone simulator or download the Expo Go app on your phone and connect it your computer

Either clone the project or download the zip file for the project

Open the project into your preferred IDE

In your terminal navigate to the projectâ€™s directory

Type the command npx expo start

You may have to try sudo npx expo start if the permission is denied

Then type the command prompted from the Metro bundler either for iOS or Android
